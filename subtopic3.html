            <td>Telemedicine is an advancement in technology that has helped to improve patient care by giving patients the opportunity to see providers by medical device. Giving both the patient and the provider the opportunity to create an easier lifestyle. It gives patients a sense of safety knowing that if they are sick they do not have to go outside and spread disease as well as being able to easily hop on a call instead of waiting in a waiting room if they can’t even get out of bed. Improvements to telehealth are being made everyday to help control spread of sickness and help patients. </td>

            <td>With telehealth there are many benefits. During the time when Covid-19 was at its highest rate it was used very frequently, helping to reduce spread of disease. Helping to still provide care from the comfort of a patient's home. There are still some limitations that are being improved with telemedicine in healthcare including different demographics and insurance concerns. This is also something just in everyday healthcare that is a struggle and something that will need to be improved in the future. Using apps, portals and records keeping everything in place with telemedicine and improving it as technology improves as well.</td>
